# HPX based FFT with FFTW3 as 1D backend

This repo is currently under active developement.
## Structure

- /src contains different shared-memory and distributed implementations 
of the same 2D FFT example

- /plot/data contains runtimes for a 16 node cluster (buran) and a 128 core dual socket system (ipvs-epyc2)
